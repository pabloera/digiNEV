CLEANUP SPECIALIST - FILES TO DELETE
==========================================
Date: 2025-06-15
Purpose: Priority 1 cleanup for 67% storage reduction

CATEGORY 1: Test Chunk Files (100 files, 400KB)
cache/streaming/test_chunk_*.chunk (all files from 0-99)

CATEGORY 2: Old Benchmark Results (keep latest 3)
benchmark_results/ - remove oldest files, keep latest 3

CATEGORY 3: TDD Stub Files (completed implementation stubs)
src/anthropic_integration/unified_pipeline_stub.py
src/core/unified_cache_system_stub.py

CATEGORY 4: Archive Candidates (move to archive/)
TDD_PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION.md
TDD_PHASE4_ROADMAP.md
TDD_STATUS.md

SAFETY VERIFICATION:
- Stub files checked: NOT imported by core system
- Test chunks: Temporary test files only
- Benchmarks: Keeping latest 3 for reference
- TDD docs: Moving to archive (not deleting)

ESTIMATED STORAGE REDUCTION:
- Test chunks: 400KB
- Old benchmarks: ~50KB
- Stub files: ~5KB
- Total direct: ~455KB + archive space optimization
