## üß™ Academic Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Academic Research Pipeline
```python
from src.anthropic_integration.unified_pipeline import UnifiedAnthropicPipeline
import yaml

# Load academic configuration
with open('config/academic_optimizations.yaml') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Initialize academic pipeline
pipeline = UnifiedAnthropicPipeline(config, project_root=".")

# Process research datasets
datasets = ["data/telegram_discourse_sample.csv"]
results = pipeline.run_complete_pipeline(datasets)

# Get academic performance summary
summary = pipeline.get_academic_summary()
print(f"Research Quality Score: {summary['academic_performance']['research_quality_score']}")
```

### 2. Academic Performance Monitoring
```python
# Track academic research metrics
tracker = pipeline.performance_tracker
report = tracker.get_academic_report()

print(f"Parallel Efficiency: {report['academic_performance']['parallel_efficiency_percent']:.1f}%")
print(f"Stages Optimized: {report['academic_performance']['stages_optimized']}")
print(f"Total Processing Time: {report['academic_performance']['total_execution_time']:.2f}s")
```

### 3. Academic Budget Monitoring
```python
# Monitor research costs
budget_summary = pipeline._academic_monitor.get_budget_summary()
print(f"Budget Usage: ${budget_summary['current_usage']:.2f}/${budget_summary['monthly_budget']}")
print(f"Remaining Budget: ${budget_summary['remaining_budget']:.2f}")
```

## üìä Academic Performance Metrics

### Research Quality Indicators
- **Data Integrity Score:** Validates processing maintains research-quality data
- **Parallel Efficiency:** Percentage of stages benefiting from optimization
- **Resource Utilization:** CPU/Memory usage appropriate for academic hardware
- **Processing Reliability:** Error rates and fallback mechanisms

### Academic Benchmarks
| Dataset Size | Expected Time | Memory Usage | Cost Estimate |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Small (1K)  | 5 minutes     | 1-2 GB       | $0.10-0.50    |
| Medium (10K)| 15 minutes    | 2-3 GB       | $0.50-2.00    |

## üîß Academic Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Pipeline runs in basic mode (no parallel processing)
```
‚úÖ Solution: Week 3-4 optimizations not available
- Check if optimization files exist in src/optimized/
- Verify dependencies: psutil, concurrent.futures
- Review academic_optimizations.yaml configuration
```

**Issue:** High memory usage on academic laptop
```
‚úÖ Solution: Adjust academic memory limits
academic:
  parallel_processing:
    memory_limit_mb: 2048  # Reduce to 2GB
  streaming:
    chunk_size: 250        # Smaller chunks
    max_chunks_in_memory: 2
```

**Issue:** Processing too slow for research deadlines
```
‚úÖ Solution: Enable more aggressive academic optimization
academic:
  parallel_processing:
    max_thread_workers: 6  # Increase if CPU allows
    cpu_threshold: 85.0    # Allow higher CPU usage
```
