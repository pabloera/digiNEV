## üöÄ Academic Implementation Details

### Week 3: Parallel Processing Integration
```python
# Academic parallel stages with conservative resource usage
parallel_stages = {
    '07_linguistic_processing': ProcessingType.CPU_BOUND,    # spaCy NLP
    '09_topic_modeling': ProcessingType.MIXED,              # Voyage.ai
    '10_tfidf_extraction': ProcessingType.CPU_BOUND,        # TF-IDF
    '11_clustering': ProcessingType.CPU_BOUND,              # Clustering
    '12_hashtag_normalization': ProcessingType.CPU_BOUND,   # Text processing
    '13_domain_analysis': ProcessingType.IO_BOUND,          # URL analysis
    '14_temporal_analysis': ProcessingType.CPU_BOUND        # Time patterns
}

# Academic-friendly resource configuration
parallel_config = ParallelConfig(
    max_thread_workers=4,      # Conservative for academic laptops
    max_process_workers=2,     # Modest CPU usage
    memory_threshold_mb=3072,  # 3GB limit for academic use
    cpu_threshold_percent=75.0 # Keep CPU usage reasonable
)
```

### Week 3: Streaming Integration
```python
# Memory-efficient streaming for academic datasets
streaming_config = StreamConfig(
    chunk_size=500,             # Smaller chunks for academic use
    max_chunks_in_memory=3,     # Conservative memory usage
    memory_threshold_mb=3072,   # Match parallel processing limit
    compression_enabled=True,   # Save storage space
    lazy_loading=True          # Load data as needed
)
```

### Week 4: Academic Monitoring
```python
# Research quality validation and performance tracking
class AcademicPerformanceTracker:
    - Records execution time, memory usage, parallelization status
    - Calculates research quality score (0-100)
    - Tracks parallel efficiency percentage
    - Generates academic-appropriate performance reports
```
