## üìä Understanding Your Results

### Political Classification System
The system categorizes messages using Brazilian political taxonomy:

| Category | Portuguese Term | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Far Right | Extrema Direita | Authoritarian, anti-democratic discourse |
| Right | Direita | Conservative political positions |
| Center-Right | Centro-Direita | Moderate conservative views |
| Center | Centro/Neutro | Non-partisan or balanced content |
| Center-Left | Centro-Esquerda | Moderate progressive views |
| Left | Esquerda | Progressive political positions |

### Key Metrics Generated
- **Political Orientation Distribution**: Percentage breakdown by category
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral)
- **Topic Modeling**: Main discussion themes (e.g., economy, security, health)
- **Temporal Evolution**: How discourse changes over time
- **Network Analysis**: Coordination patterns and influence networks

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Support for Researchers

### System Validation
```bash
# Comprehensive system check
poetry run python academic_deploy.py --validate

# Test optimization systems
poetry run python test_all_weeks_consolidated.py

# Memory usage monitoring
poetry run python -c "
from src.optimized.memory_optimizer import get_global_memory_manager
manager = get_global_memory_manager()
print(manager.get_memory_summary())
"
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Out of memory errors
**Solution**: Reduce dataset size or enable streaming mode
```bash
poetry run python run_pipeline.py --streaming --chunk-size 500
```

**Issue**: API rate limits
**Solution**: Enable intelligent caching and reduce API calls
```bash
poetry run python -c "
from src.optimized.smart_claude_cache import get_smart_cache
cache = get_smart_cache()
print(f'Cache hit rate: {cache.get_hit_rate():.1%}')
"
```

**Issue**: Cost concerns
**Solution**: Use academic sampling mode
```bash
poetry run python run_pipeline.py --academic-mode --sample-rate 0.1
```

### Getting Help
1. **System Validation**: Run `academic_deploy.py --validate` first
2. **Log Files**: Check `logs/` directory for detailed error information
3. **Configuration**: Verify `config/academic_settings.yaml` settings
4. **Memory Issues**: Monitor with built-in memory optimizer
